An undertale fan-made battle

This is my first try to upload some code i've already made into gitHub, is a fanmade battle based on the game Undertale, by Toby Fox.
The boss is an character made by a friend of mine, wich we call "Morceguinho".

Opening the project:

The project is made in Eclipse, so just download the folder and open it in Ecplise.
It may give some errors
